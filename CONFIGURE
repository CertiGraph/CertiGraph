# Build configuration
#
# This file gets included into `Makefile` and overrides any defaults
# set there.
#
# These settings can also be specified at the command-line. For example,
#
#     $ make VAR_1=VAL_1 ... VAR_N=VAL_N target
#
# Note that values specified at the command-line take precedence over
# the defaults found in `Makefile` and the values found in this file.
#



# Controls the build target. Two values are supported:
#     32, which corresponds to CompCert's `x86_32-linux` target
#     64, which corresponds to CompCert's `x86_64-linux` target
#     opam, which corresponds to the `coq-compcert` package in opam.
#
# This value must be aligned with your CompCert and VST installation.
#
# BITSIZE=opam


# Path to clightgen.
# If you leave this unset, `Makefile` will use `BITSIZE` and `coqc -where`
# to attempt to locate compcert automatically.
#
# CLIGHTGEN=../compcert/bin/clightgen


# Path to CompCert.
# If you leave this unset, `Makefile` will use `BITSIZE` and `coqc -where`
# to attempt to locate compcert automatically.
#
# COMPCERT_DIR=../compcert


# Path to VST.
# If you leave this unset, `Makefile` will use `BITSIZE` and `coqc -where`
# to attempt to locate VST automatically.
#
# VST_DIR=../VST
