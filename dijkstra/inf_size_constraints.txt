List of constraints on inf and size

in AdjMatGraph:
 sr: (* size_representable *)
      0 < size <= Int.max_signed;

 ir: (* inf_representable *)
 	  0 <= inf <= Int.max_signed; 
   
in MathDijkGraph:
  sfr: (* size is further restricted *)
    size * 4 <= Int.max_signed;
  
  ifr: (* inf is further restricted *)
    0 < inf < Int.max_signed


Reasons:
In sr, size = 0 is impossible because we define edge weight's range as 0 ... MAX/size
In sfr, size * 4 <= MAX is needed because we malloc (size * sizeof(tint))
In ifr, 
	inf = 0 is impossible for a number of reasons. 
		    One is that elabel(i,i) = 0 (cost to self)
		    and we can't allow inf to occupy that magic value
 	inf < MAX because pq uses inf + 1 as a "popped" signifier.
 		 	Perhaps this can be massaged away?
