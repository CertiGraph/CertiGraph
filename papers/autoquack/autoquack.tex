\begin{abstract}
We show how to mechanically verify programs manipulating data structures with intrinsic sharing such as heap-represented graphs.  We upgrade the theory of ramification to better support modified program variables and existential quantifiers in assertions.  We develop a modular and general setup for reasoning about mathematical graphs and show
how to connect this setup to a general theory for graphs in separation logic.  We connect our theories to two verification tools with different levels of automation and use them to verify several canonical graph algorithms. Our proofs are entirely machine-checked in Coq.

\section{Introduction}
Over the last fifteen years great strides have been made in automating verifications of programs that manipulate
tree-like data structures using separation logic CITE CITE CITE.  Unfortunately, verifying programs that manipulate
graph-like data structures (e.g. structures with \emph{intrinsic sharing}) has been far more challenging.
Indeed, verifying such programs was formidable enough that a number of the early landmark results in separation logic
devoted substantial efforts to verify single examples such as Schorr-Waite~\cite{hongseok:phd} and XXX CITE with pen and
paper---avoiding entirely the additional challenges inherent in machine-assisted reasoning.

In recent years, Hobor and Villard introduced the concept of \emph{ramification} as a kind of proof pattern or framework
to verify graph-manipulating programs with pen and paper~\cite{hobor:ramification}, but left open the question of how such proofs could
be incorporated in a machine-assisted setting.  In this paper, we show how this can be done, and demonstrate the
value of our approach by adding ramification to two rather sizeable---albeit quite differently flavored---separation logic-based
verification tools: the Coq-based tactic system of the Verified Software Toolchain CITE and the more highly-automated HIP/SLEEK
program verifier~\cite{chin:hipsleek}.  Despite the substantial differences between these systems, the vast majority of our infrastructure is
shared between them, and since many of the other computer-assisted verification tools under development
today CITE CITE CITE CITE have much in common with at least one of these tools, we believe that our techniques will be
applicable to many other systems as well.

Along the way we develop an improved proof rule for ramification that supports existential variables and enjoys a smoother interaction with

Along the way we discover---and show how to fix---a rather subtle error in Hobor and Villard's presentation: neither the
Knaster-Tarski \cite{tarski:fixpoint} nor the Appel-McAllester \cite{appel:fixpoint} method for solving recursive fixpoints is suitable for defining
recursive graph predicates in separation logic.

  We also develop a general framework for defining and reasoning about mathematical
graphs and

different kinds of mathematical
graphs can be implemented in separation logic in a uniform way;

so that it can handle a wider variety of data structures;

We use both systems to verify a number of different programs utilizing graph-manipulating structures,
letting us understand the advantages and disadvantages of both.

5. Mark algorithm
5.1. For Ramification-Paper-style proof
5.1.1. Math land theorems for marking algorithm (general situation and bi-graph situation) are all proved. Mainly in "\texttt{marked\_graph.v}" and "\texttt{spatial\_graph\_mark\_bi.v}".
5.1.2. Ramification rule for marking algorithm (bi-graph situation) are all proved in "\texttt{spatial\_graph\_mark\_bi.v}".
5.1.3. Combining 2.4 and 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, we have a end-to-end proof for marking-graph in VST.
5.1.4. We have an end-to-end proof for marking-dag, but not defining dag predicate as a whole.
5.1.5. The module type which will be generated by HIP/SLEEK should be instantiated by 2.2 and 2.5.

6. Spanning tree algorithm
6.1. We divide the spanning tree relation into structural part and marking part. They are both defined properly.
6.2. Important pure facts and ramification rules are not proved yet.
6.3. Shengyi has already known how to use VST to handle the C program of bigraph spanning tree.
