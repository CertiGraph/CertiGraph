All of our results in this paper have been machine-checked.  The vast bulk of our development was checked in Coq, although a 55-line file (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hipmarkgraph}) was checked in HIP/SLEEK.  Our modifications to HIP/SLEEK itself were not machine-checked since HIP/SLEEK does not have a mechanized soundness proof.
Although the size of a development does not perfectly match with that development's importance or implementation difficulty, we present it nonetheless in Table~\ref{tab:codebase}, organized roughly by the paper section corresponding to each development.  It took fewer than 400 lines of Coq to verify the \li{mark} algorithm in HIP/SLEEK, indicating that a large portion of the codebase is shared between VST and H/S.

include \li{Graph.v} and \li{GraphBi.v} from \li{msl_application} since they do not depend on the underlying VST model?

What do copy or dispose share with mark or with each other?

total: 1,038 (marks) + 2,064 (copy/dispose, assuming no duplication) = 3,102 lines.  12 files, assuming no sharing for copy/dispose (with each other or with mark)

\paragraph{Size of H/S example.}
main file: 54 lines (Figure~\ref{fig:hipmarkgraph}), \li{Module Type} generated by H/S (Figure~\ref{fig:hipcoqfile}) is 30 lines, Coq \li{Module} matching this \li{Module Type} is 358 lines.
total: 2 human-generated files, 429 lines
