In the future we plan to improve the pure reasoning of graphs and
similar data structures.  We plan to verify a garbage
collector algorithm for the ``CertiCoq'' project, which is building 
a certified compiler from Gallina to Clight. We would like to investigate
using our externally verified lemmas in HIP/SLEEK to verify code such as fast
exponentiation and more graph algorithms. We also would like to make
the interface between Coq and HIP/SLEEK simpler and cleaner.
One final direction we would like to investigate is using our new
connection to Coq to have HIP/SLEEK output certificates as it 
verifies programs so that the system becomes more trustworthy.

Our main contributions were as follows.  We generalized the \infrulestyle{Ramify}
rule to handle modified program and existential quantifiers in postconditions
more smoothly.  We developed a general and modular framework for reasoning
about mathematical graphs and a general and modular spatial library for
reasoning about graphs in the heap.  We provided a sound definition for \p{graph}
that still obeyed the fold/unfold relationship.  We connected our reasoning
to two verification tools and used them to verify several graph-manipulating algorithms.
