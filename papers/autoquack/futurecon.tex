As future work, we plan to improve the pure reasoning of graphs and
similar data structures. We also have plan to verify a garbage
collector algorithm of CertiCoq, which is a project focuses on a
certified compiler from Gallina to Clight. On HIP/SLEEK side, we tend
to use extensions to verify other kinds of code such as fast
exponentiation and more graph algorithms. We also have plan to make
the interface between Coq and HIP/SLEEK simpler and cleaner. Having
HIP/SLEEK to output certificates about algorithm is under
consideration, too.

As a conclusion, we generalize the Ramify rule, mechanize a generic
library of ramification rule, develop a general framework of
mathematical graphs and put them together successfully verify serveral
tricky graph-manipulating algorthm from end-to-end by two different
tools.
