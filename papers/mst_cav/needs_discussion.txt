Not done / needs discussion

1. If you want we can remove the red text from fig 1, and with it, the second sentence of \S3.1
2. He suggested killing the reference in the abstract. I don't often see references in abstracts but IDK what the done thing is. Thoughts?
3. Intro: full functional correctness
4. he didn't like that \mathcal{V} is used to start sentences...
5. In prim.tex, we start sentences with "Indeed, blah...". he doesn't like that.
6. He says not to use line numbers in code listings if they're not going to be referred to.
