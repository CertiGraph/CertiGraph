I: Known issues
```````````````
- In the gc code, does the nursery get collected when half-full or full? 
- kleene star is technially meant to be an asterisk, not a five-pointed solid star
- do_scan uses header_t while forward uses Hd_val to grab the header. It's probably not an actual bug, it's being handled using weird loop init values etc. But certainly weird and hard to justify. Change for presentation?
    in do_scan: header_t hd = *((header_t *) s); 
    in forward: header_t hd = Hd_val(v);
    where, in gc.h, the definition is Hd_val(val) (((header_t *) (val)) [-1]) 


II: Weak sections
`````````````````
- new rule and treatment of local variables, we don't show it off adequately
- explanation of UF
- things in MarkGraph/DAG that are not in UF
- GC proof
- spatial defn of graph, fold/unfold
- Things to expand in GC:
  + resetting the whole heap
  + calc and alloc a new generation
  + handling roots
  + forward_roots
  + proving graph iso as a composition of all the relations.
