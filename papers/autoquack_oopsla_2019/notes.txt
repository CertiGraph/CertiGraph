I: Known issues
```````````````
- In the gc code, does the nursery get collected when half-full or full? 
- kleene star is technially meant to be an asterisk, not a five-pointed solid star

II: Weak sections
`````````````````
- new rule and treatment of local variables, we don't show it off adequately
- explanation of UF
- things in MarkGraph/DAG that are not in UF
- GC proof
- spatial defn of graph, fold/unfold
- Things to expand in GC:
  + resetting the whole heap
  + calc and alloc a new generation
  + handling roots
  + forward_roots
  + proving graph iso as a composition of all the relations.

III: Defer till later
