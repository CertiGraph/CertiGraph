In the future we plan to improve the pure reasoning of graphs and
similar data structures.  We are in the process of verifying a garbage
collector for the ``CertiCoq'' project, which is building
a certified compiler from Gallina to Clight. We would like to investigate
using our externally verified lemmas in HIP/SLEEK to verify code such as fast
exponentiation and more graph algorithms. We also would like to make
the interface between Coq and H/S simpler and cleaner.
One final direction we would like to investigate is using our new
connection to Coq to have H/S output certificates as it
verifies programs so that the system becomes more trustworthy.

Our main contributions were as follows.  We connected our reasoning
to two verification tools and used them to verify several graph-manipulating algorithms.
We generalized the \infrulestyle{Ramify}
rule to handle modified program variables and existential quantifiers in postconditions
more smoothly.  We developed a general and modular framework for reasoning
about mathematical graphs and a general and modular spatial library for
reasoning about graphs in the heap.  We gave a sound definition for \p{graph}
that still enjoys fold/unfold.
