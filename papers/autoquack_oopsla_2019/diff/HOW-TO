HOW-TO

1. Make a fake autoquack_old.tex.
	a) Grab the latest autoquack.tex, and sub in the old abstract.
	b) Do not sub in the old acks, it will make it break. This has to be made entirely blue+squiggly in the last step.
	c) Run latexdiff on old vs new to generate a diff with the dif macros defiend in the preamble

2. For each imported file, 
	a) run latexdiff
	b) edit autoquack_diff to import the diff version of the file
	c) make sure that it compiles 
	d) very breaky, be careful

3. Finally, once it is all building, manually make the acks blue-squiggly in the diff tex file
