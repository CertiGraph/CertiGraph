HOW TO SET UP YOUR ENVIRMENT

1. Download and Unpack
1.1. Download CompCert 2.6 and unpack it into your CompCert folder.
1.2. Download VST of master branch (commit 4fd994630bd25eb15417cdccb1a28d54663d7190) and unpack it into your VST folder.
1.3. Download RamifyCoq and unpack it into your Ramify folder.
1.4. It is not necessary for your folder names to be CompCert, VST and/or Ramify, you can feel free to name them in your own way.

2. Build CompCert
2.1. Run "./configure" in your CompCert folder.
2.2. Run "make all" and "make clightgen" in your CompCert folder.

2. Build VST
2.1. Create a file CONFIGURE in your VST folder with two lines of text in it: "COMPCERT=[Your CompCert Folder]" and "LIBPREFIX=VST"
2.2. If this is the first time you use VST, you can ignore this line. Do "make clean" in your VST folder.
2.3. Run "make -kj3" or "make -kj7" to build VST. There will be some error. That would be fine, don't worry.

3. Build RamifyCoq
3.1. Create a file CONFIGURE in your RamifyCoq folder with these two lines in it:
       COMPCERT_DIR=[Your CompCert Folder]
       VST_DIR=[Your VST Folder]
3.2. Run "make all" in your RamifyCoq folder.

4. Set up your ProofGeneral Environment.
4.1. Install ProofGeneral in your computer.
4.2. Add ProofGeneral into your emacs setting files.
4.3. Add these two paragragh into your emacs setting files.

(custom-set-variables '(coq-prog-args '(
"-R" "[Your CompCert Folder]" "-as" "compcert" 
"-R" "[Your VST Folder]" "-as" "VST" 
"-R" "[Your RamifyCoq Folder]" "-as" "RamifyCoq"))) 

(setq coq-load-path '(("[Your CompCert Folder]" "compcert")
                      ("[Your VST Folder]" "VST")
                      ("[Your RamifyCoq Folder]" "RamifyCoq")))

5. Done. You can play with RamifyCoq now.
